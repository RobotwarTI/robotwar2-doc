ROBOT WAR 2: THE BIONIC WARS (version 0.2.0 beta)

KNOWN ISSUES:

- There is not yet support for Automatic Power-Down (APD).  Feature to be added later?
- Events behave oddly after defeating Oceanside boss (behavior is half text, half shop interface without cursor)
- The skateboarding minigame will end abruptly.
- Collecting acheivements will not yet count toward you acheivement total
- Colliding with an non-playable character will make Edgar dither between pixels.  
- Jump is not disabled early in the game (after the skateboarding mini, but before eating fruit for HP)
- Reload rate for text scolling and item purchasing may spike for <1 second.
- Exploding barrels are still in progress, but mostly work
- Bowling lane tiles have been commented out temporarily (will appear garbled)
- If camera detactches from Edgar (ex: riding an elevator), it will seek his location, but may overshoot. (minor issue)
- Noticed enemy: "spy" appeared in the Crab's Cove area.  How did it get there?
- All areas beyond Oceanside are under construction, unlinked, or otherwise inaccessable.
- Spell-checking has been minimal so far
