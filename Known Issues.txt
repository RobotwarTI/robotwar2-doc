GAMEPLAY:

- Jump is not disabled early in the game (after the skateboarding mini, but before eating fruit for HP)
- Reload rate for text scolling and item purchasing may spike for <1 second.
- Exploding barrels are still in progress, but mostly work
- Bowling lane tiles have been commented out temporarily (will appear garbled)
- If camera detactches from Edgar (ex: riding an elevator), it will seek his location, but may overshoot. (minor issue)
- Noticed enemy: "spy" appeared in the Crab's Cove area.  How did it get there?
