Weapons:
--------
  Use [MODE] to cycle through your energy attacks.  Your default attack
  uses no energy, but also has the least range and knockback.
  
  Your energy weapons are Fire, Water, Metal, Wind, and Earth.
  Each one has a specific strength or weakness based on the enemy.
    
  Increase your attack (ATK) to deal x2, x3, or x4 hits to your 
  opponents.
  
  Experimentation is the best.

  by descrambling the letters that appear.  Use [UP][DOWN][LEFT][RIGHT]
  to move your cursor.  Press [2ND] to swap the 2 letters inside the 
  cursor.

  - Eat food often.  Combat will slowly deplete any stat boosts
    you have received from your latest 3 meals.  When in doubt, 
    pause with [ENTER] to view your "STAT" display.

  - Experiment with different energy attacks on the same enemy.

  - Breathing underwater is bad.

  - Jump over traffic cones to gain a skill bonus!
  
  - Back up your games by archiving a copy.
  
  - If you drop an item while in a store, you will get a small refund.
